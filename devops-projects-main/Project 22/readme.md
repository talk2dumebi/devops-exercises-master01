# PROJECT 22 - DEPLOYING APPLICATIONS INTO KUBERNETES CLUSTER

[Project Repository](https://github.com/Hack-Light/k8s-project-files)

In this project, you will build upon your knowledge of Kubernetes architecture, and begin to deploy applications on a K8s cluster. Kubernetes has a lot of moving parts; it operates with several layers of abstraction between your application and host machines where it runs. So many terms, and capabilities that is not realistic to learn it all at once. Hence, you will be introduced to as many concepts as possible, but gradually.

Within this project we are going to learn and see in action following:

Deployment of software applications using YAML manifest files with following K8s objects:

- Pods
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- StatefulSets
- Services (ClusterIP, NodeIP, Loadbalancer)
- Configmaps
- Volumes
- PersistentVolumes
- PersistentVolumeClaims
- …and many more

### Choosing the right Kubernetes cluster set up

When it comes to using a Kubernetes cluster, there is a number of options available depending on the ultimate use of it. For example, if you just need a cluster for development or learning, you can use lightweight tools like Minikube, or k3s. These tools can run on your workstation without heavy system requirements. Obviously, there is limit to the amount of workload you can deploy there for testing purposes, but it works exactly like any other Kubernetes cluster.

On the other hand, if you need something more robust, suitable for a production workload and with more advanced capabilities such as horizontal scaling of the worker nodes, then you can consider building own Kubernetes cluster from scratch just as you did in Project 21. If you have been able to automate the entire bootstrap using Ansible, you can easily spin up your nodes with Terraform, and configure the cluster with your Ansible configuration scripts.

It it a great combination of tools responsible for different parts of your applications:

- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Ansible for cluster master and worker nodes configuration
- Kubernetes for deploying your containerized application and orchestrating the deployment

Other options will be to leverage a Managed Service Kubernetes cluster from public cloud providers such as: AWS EKS, Microsoft AKS, or Google Cloud Platform GKE. There are so many more options out there. Regardless of whichever one you choose, the experience is usually very similar.

Most organisations choose Managed Service options for obvious reasons such as:

- Less administrative overheads
- Reduced cost of ownership
- Improved Security
- Seamless support
- Periodical updates to a stable and well-tested version
- Faster cluster spin up
- … and many more

However, there is usually strong reasons why organisations with very strict compliance and security concerns choose to build their own Kubernetes clusters. Most of the companies that go this route will mostly use on-premises data centres. When there is need to store data privately due to its sensitive nature, companies will rather not use a public cloud provider. Because, if they do, they have no idea of the physical location of the data centre in which their data is being persisted. Banks and Governments are typical examples of this.

Some setup options can combine both public and private cloud together. For example, the master nodes, etcd clusters, and some worker nodes that run stateful applications can be configured in private datacentres, while worker nodes that require heavy computations and stateless applications can run in public clouds. This kind of hybrid architecture is ideal to satisfy compliance, while also benefiting from other public cloud capabilities.

### Deploying the Tooling app using Kubernetes objects

In this section, you will begin to write configuration files for Kubernetes objects (they are usually referred as manifests) in the form of files with yaml syntax and deploy them using kubectl console.

But first, let us understand what a Kubernetes object is.

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Specifically, they can describe:

- What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
- The resources available to those applications
- The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance

These objects are `"record of intent"` – once you create the object, the Kubernetes system will constantly work to ensure that the object exists. By creating an object, you are effectively telling the Kubernetes system what you want your cluster’s workload to look like; this is your cluster’s desired state.

To work with Kubernetes objects – whether to create, modify, or delete them – you will need to use the Kubernetes API. When you use the kubectl command-line interface, for example, the CLI makes the necessary Kubernetes API calls for you. It is also possible to use curl to directly interact with the Kubernetes API, or it can be as part of developing a program in different programming languages. That will require some advance knowledge. You can read more about client libraries to get an idea on how that works.

### UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT

Let us try to understand a bit more about how the service object is able to route traffic to the Pod.

If you run the below command:

`kubectl get service nginx-service -o wide`

You will get the output similar to this:

```bash
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE   SELECTOR
nginx-service   ClusterIP   10.100.71.130   <none>        80/TCP    4d    app=nginx-pod
```

As you already know, the service’s type is ClusterIP, and in the above output, it has the IP address of `10.100.71.130` – This IP works just like an internal loadbalancer. It accepts requests and forwards it to an IP address of any Pod that has the respective selector label. In this case, it is app=nginx-pod. If there is more than one Pod with that label, service will distribute the traffic to all theese pofs in a Round Robin fashion.

Now, let us have a look at what the Pod looks like:

```bash
kubectl get pod nginx-pod --show-labels
Output:


NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          31m   app=nginx-pod
```

Notice that the IP address of the Pod, is NOT the IP address of the server it is running on. Kubernetes, through the implementation of network plugins assigns virtual IP adrresses to each Pod.

```bash
kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o wide
Output:

NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP               NODE                                              NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          57m   172.50.197.236   ip-172-50-197-215.eu-central-1.compute.internal   <none>           <none>
```

Therefore, Service with IP 10.100.71.130 takes request and forwards to Pod with IP 172.50.197.236

### Self Side Task:

- Build the Tooling app Dockerfile and push it to Dockerhub registry

- Write a Pod and a Service manifests, ensure that you can access the Tooling app’s frontend using port-forwarding feature.

- Expose a Service on a server’s public IP address & static port

![project22](./images/10.png)

Sometimes, it may be needed to directly access the application using the public IP of the server (when we speak of a K8s cluster we can replace ‘server’ with ‘node’) the Pod is running on. This is when the NodePort service type comes in handy.

A Node port service type exposes the service on a static port on the node’s IP address. NodePorts are in the 30000-32767 range by default, which means a NodePort is unlikely to match a service’s intended port (for example, 80 may be exposed as 30080).

Update the nginx-service yaml to use a NodePort Service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: nginx-service
spec:
type: NodePort
selector:
app: nginx-pod
ports: - protocol: TCP
port: 80
nodePort: 30080
```

What has changed is:

Specified the type of service (Nodeport)
Specified the NodePort number to use.

To access the service, you must:

- Allow the inbound traffic in your EC2’s Security Group to the NodePort range 30000-32767

- Get the public IP address of the node the Pod is running on, append the nodeport and access the app through the browser.

You must understand that the port number 30080 is a port on the node in which the Pod is scheduled to run. If the Pod ever gets rescheduled elsewhere, that the same port number will be used on the new node it is running on. So, if you have multiple Pods running on several nodes at the same time – they all will be exposed on respective nodes’ IP addresses with a static port number.

#### How Kubernetes ensures desired number of Pods is always running?

When we define a Pod manifest and appy it – we create a Pod that is running until it’s terminated for some reason (e.g., error, Node reboot or some other reason), but what if we want to declare that we always need at least 3 replicas of the same Pod running at all times? Then we must use an ResplicaSet (RS) object – it’s purpose is to maintain a stable set of Pod replicas running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

> Note: In some older books or documents you might find the old version of a similar object – ReplicationController (RC), it had similar purpose, but did not support set-base label selectors and it is now recommended to use ReplicaSets instead, since it is the next-generation RC.

Let us delete our nginx-pod Pod:

```bash
kubectl delete -f nginx-pod.yaml

# Output:

pod "nginx-pod" deleted
```

### COMMON KUBERNETES OBJECTS

- Pod
- Namespace
- ResplicaSet (Manages Pods)
- DeploymentController (Manages Pods)
- StatefulSet
- DaemonSet
- Service
- ConfigMap
- Volume
- Job/Cronjob

The very first concept to understand is the difference between how Docker and Kubernetes run containers – with Docker, every docker run command will run an image (representing an application) as a container. The running container is a Docker’s smallest entity, it is the most basic deployable object. Kubernetes on the other hand operates with pods instead of containers, a pods encapsulates a container. Kubernetes uses pods as its smallest, and most basic deployable object with a unique feature that allows it to run multiple containers within a single Pod. It is not the most common pattern – to have more than one container in a Pod, but there are cases when this capability comes in handy.

In the world of docker, or docker compose, to run the Tooling app, you must deploy separate containers for the application and the database. But in the world of Kubernetes, you can run both: application and database containers in the same Pod. When multiple containers run within the same Pod, they can directly communicate with each other as if they were running on the same localhost. Although running both the application and database in the same Pod is NOT a recommended approach.

A Pod that contains one container is called single container pod and it is the most common Kubernetes use case. A Pod that contains multiple co-related containers is called multi-container pod. There are few patterns for multi-container Pods; one of them is the sidecar container pattern – it means that in the same Pod there is a main container and an auxiliary one that extends and enhances the functionality of the main one without changing it.

There are other patterns, such as: init container, adapter container, ambassador container. These are more advanced topics that you can study on your own, let us continue with the other objects.

We will not go into the theoretical details of all the objects, rather we will begin to experience them in action.

### Understanding the common YAML fields for every Kubernetes object

Every Kubernetes object includes object fields that govern the object’s configuration:

- kind: Represents the type of kubernetes object created. It can be a Pod, DaemonSet, Deployments or Service.
- version: Kubernetes api version used to create the resource, it can be v1, v1beta and v2. Some of the kubernetes features can be released under beta and available for general public usage.
- metadata: provides information about the resource like name of the Pod, namespace under which the Pod will be running,
- labels and annotations.
- spec: consists of the core information about Pod. Here we will tell kubernetes what would be the expected state of resource, Like container image, number of replicas, environment variables and volumes.
- status: consists of information about the running object, status of each container. Status field is supplied and updated by Kubernetes after creation. This is not something you will have to put in the YAML manifest.

### Deploying a random Pod

Lets see what it looks like to have a Pod running in a k8s cluster. This section is just to illustrate and get you to familiarise with how the object’s fields work. Lets deploy a basic Nginx container to run inside a Pod.

- apiVersion is v1
- kind is Pod
- metatdata has a name which is set to nginx-pod
- The spec section has further information about the Pod. Where to find the image to run the container – (This defaults to Docker Hub), the port and protocol.

The structure is similar for any Kubernetes objects, and you will get to see them all as we progress.

Create a Pod yaml manifest on your master node

```bash
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: nginx-pod
spec:
containers:

- image: nginx:latest
  name: nginx-pod
  ports:
- containerPort: 80
  protocol: TCP
EOF
# Apply the manifest with the help of kubectl

kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
```

Get an output of the pods running in the cluster

`kubectl get pods`

To see other fields introduced by kubernetes after you have deployed the resource, simply run below command, and examine the output. You will see other fields that kubernetes updates from time to time to represent the state of the resource within the cluster. `-o` simply means the output format.

`kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o yaml`

or

`kubectl describe pod nginx-pod`

![project22](./images/11.png)

### ACCESSING THE APP FROM THE BROWSER

Now you have a running Pod. What’s next?

The ultimate goal of any solution is to access it either through a web portal or some application (e.g., mobile app). We have a Pod with Nginx container, so we need to access it from the browser. But all you have is a running Pod that has its own IP address which cannot be accessed through the browser. To achieve this, we need another Kubernetes object called Service to accept our request and pass it on to the Pod.

A service is an object that accepts requests on behalf of the Pods and forwards it to the Pod’s IP address. If you run the command below, you will be able to see the Pod’s IP address. But there is no way to reach it directly from the outside world.

Run kubectl to connect inside the container

```bash
kubectl run curl --image=dareyregistry/curl -i --tty
# Run curl and point to the IP address of the Nginx Pod (Use the IP address of your own Pod)

# curl -v <pod-ip-address>:80
```

![project22](./images/12.png)

If the use case for your solution is required for internal use ONLY, without public Internet requirement. Then, this should be OK. But in most cases, it is NOT!

Assuming that your requirement is to access the Nginx Pod internally, using the Pod’s IP address directly as above is not a reliable choice because Pods are ephemeral. They are not designed to run forever. When they die and another Pod is brought back up, the IP address will change and any application that is using the previous IP address directly will break.

To solve this problem, kubernetes uses Service – An object that abstracts the underlining IP addresses of Pods. A service can serve as a load balancer, and a reverse proxy which basically takes the request using a human readable DNS name, resolves to a Pod IP that is running and forwards the request to it. This way, you do not need to use an IP address. Rather, you can simply refer to the service name directly.

Let us create a service to access the Nginx Pod

Create a Service yaml manifest file:

```bash
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: nginx-service
spec:
selector:
app: nginx-pod
ports: - protocol: TCP
port: 80
targetPort: 80
EOF
# Create a nginx-service resource by applying your manifest
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml

# Check the created service
kubectl get service

```

Observation:
The TYPE column in the output shows that there are different service types.

- ClusterIP
- NodePort
- LoadBalancer &
- Headless Service

Since we did not specify any type, it is obvious that the default type is `ClusterIP`

Now that we have a service created, how can we access the app? Since there is no public IP address, we can leverage kubectl's port-forward functionality.

`kubectl port-forward svc/nginx-service 8089:80`

`8089` is an arbitrary port number on your laptop or client PC, and we want to tunnel traffic through it to the port number of the nginx-service `80`.

Unfortunately, this will not work quite yet. Because there is no way the service will be able to select the actual Pod it is meant to route traffic to. If there are hundreds of Pods running, there must be a way to ensure that the service only forwards requests to the specific Pod it is intended for.

To make this work, you must reconfigure the Pod manifest and introduce labels to match the selectors key in the field section of the service manifest.

Update the Pod manifest with the below and apply the manifest:

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: nginx-pod
labels:
app: nginx-pod
spec:
containers:

- image: nginx:latest
  name: nginx-pod
  ports: - containerPort: 80
  protocol: TCP
```

Notice that under the metadata section, we have now introduced labels with a key field called app and its value nginx-pod. This matches exactly the selector key in the service manifest.

The key/value pairs can be anything you specify. These are not Kubernetes specific keywords. As long as it matches the selector, the service object will be able to route traffic to the Pod.

Apply the manifest with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
# Run kubectl port-forward command again
kubectl port-forward svc/nginx-service 8089:80
```

Then go to your web browser and enter localhost:8089 – You should now be able to see the nginx page in the browser.

### CREATE A REPLICA SET

Let us create a rs.yaml manifest for a ReplicaSet object:

```yaml
#Part 1
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
name: nginx-rs
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
app: nginx-pod
#Part 2
template:
metadata:
name: nginx-pod
labels:
app: nginx-pod
spec:
containers: - image: nginx:latest
name: nginx-pod
ports: - containerPort: 80
protocol: TCP
```

`kubectl apply -f rs.yaml`

The manifest file of ReplicaSet consist of the following fields:

- apiVersion: This field specifies the version of kubernetes Api to which the object belongs. ReplicaSet belongs to apps/v1 apiVersion.
- kind: This field specify the type of object for which the manifest belongs to. Here, it is ReplicaSet.
- metadata: This field includes the metadata for the object. It mainly includes two fields: name and labels of the ReplicaSet.
- spec: This field specifies the label selector to be used to select the Pods, number of replicas of the Pod to be run and the container or list of containers which the Pod will run. In the above example, we are running 3 replicas of nginx container.

Let us check what Pods have been created:

![project22](./images/15.png)

To display detailed information about any Kubernetes object, you can use 2 differen commands:

`kubectl describe %object_type% %object_name% (e.g. kubectl describe rs nginx-rs)`

`kubectl get %object_type% %object_name% -o yaml (e.g. kubectl describe rs nginx-rs -o yaml)`

Try both commands in action and see the difference. Also try get with `-o json` instead of `-o yaml` and decide for yourself which output option is more readable for you.

Scale ReplicaSet up and down:

In general, there are 2 approaches of Kubernetes Object Management: imperative and declarative.

Let us see how we can use both to scale our Replicaset up and down:

#### Imperative:

We can easily scale our ReplicaSet up by specifying the desired number of replicas in an imperative command, like this:

```bash
❯ kubectl scale rs nginx-rs --replicas=5
replicationcontroller/nginx-rc scaled
❯ kubectl get pods
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
nginx-rc-4kgpj 1/1 Running 0 4m30s
nginx-rc-4z2pn 1/1 Running 0 4m30s
nginx-rc-g4tvg 1/1 Running 0 6s
nginx-rc-kmh8m 1/1 Running 0 6s
nginx-rc-zlgvp 1/1 Running 0 4m30s
```

Scaling down will work the same way, so scale it down to 3 replicas.

#### Declarative:

Declarative way would be to open our rs.yaml manifest, change desired number of replicas in respective section

```yml
spec:
replicas: 3
# and applying the updated manifest:

kubectl apply -f rs.yaml

# There is another method – ‘ad-hoc’, it is definitely not the best practice and we do not recommend using it, but you can edit an existing ReplicaSet with following command:

kubectl edit -f rs.yaml
```

### Advanced label matching

As Kubernetes mature as a technology, so does its features and improvements to k8s objects. ReplicationControllers do not meet certain complex business requirements when it comes to using selectors. Imagine if you need to select Pods with multiple lables that represents things like:

- Application tier: such as Frontend, or Backend
- Environment: such as Dev, SIT, QA, Preprod, or Prod

So far, we used a simple selector that just matches a key-value pair and check only ‘equality’:

- selector:
  app: nginx-pod

But in some cases, we want ReplicaSet to manage our existing containers that match certain criteria, we can use the same simple label matching or we can use some more complex conditions, such as:

- in
- not in
- not equal
- etc...
  Let us look at the following manifest file:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
name: nginx-rs
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
env: prod
matchExpressions: - { key: tier, operator: In, values: [frontend] }
template:
metadata:
name: nginx
labels:
env: prod
tier: frontend
spec:
containers: - name: nginx-container
image: nginx:latest
ports: - containerPort: 80
protocol: TCP
```

In the above spec file, under the selector, matchLabels and matchExpression are used to specify the key-value pair. The matchLabel works exactly the same way as the equality-based selector, and the matchExpression is used to specify the set based selectors. This feature is the main differentiator between ReplicaSet and previously mentioned obsolete ReplicationController.

Get the replication set:

```bash
kubectl get rs nginx-rs -o wide
```

### USING AWS LOAD BALANCER TO ACCESS YOUR SERVICE IN KUBERNETES.

> Note: You will only be able to test this using AWS EKS. You don not have to set this up in current project yet. In the next project, you will update your Terraform code to build an EKS cluster.

You have previously accessed the Nginx service through ClusterIP, and NodeIP, but there is another service type – Loadbalancer. This type of service does not only create a Service object in K8s, but also provisions a real external Load Balancer (e.g. Elastic Load Balancer – ELB in AWS)

To get the experience of this service type, update your service manifest and use the LoadBalancer type. Also, ensure that the selector references the Pods in the replica set.

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: nginx-service
spec:
type: LoadBalancer
selector:
tier: frontend
ports: - protocol: TCP
port: 80 # This is the port the Loadbalancer is listening at
targetPort: 80 # This is the port the container is listening at
```

Apply the configuration:

`kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml`

Get the newly created service :

`kubectl get service nginx-service`
output:

An ELB resource will be created in your AWS console.

A Kubernetes component in the control plane called Cloud-controller-manager is responsible for triggeriong this action. It connects to your specific cloud provider’s (AWS) APIs and create resources such as Load balancers. It will ensure that the resource is appropriately tagged:

Get the output of the entire yaml for the service. You will some additional information about this service in which you did not define them in the yaml manifest. Kubernetes did this for you.

`kubectl get service nginx-service -o yaml`

A clusterIP key is updated in the manifest and assigned an IP address. Even though you have specified a Loadbalancer service type, internally it still requires a clusterIP to route the external traffic through.

In the ports section, nodePort is still used. This is because Kubernetes still needs to use a dedicated port on the worker node to route the traffic through. Ensure that port range 30000-32767 is opened in your inbound Security Group configuration.

More information about the provisioned balancer is also published in the .status.loadBalancer field.

```
status:
loadBalancer:
ingress: - hostname: ac12145d6a8b5491d95ff8e2c6296b46-588706163.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

Copy and paste the load balancer’s address to the browser, and you will access the Nginx service

### USING DEPLOYMENT CONTROLLERS

Do not Use Replication Controllers – Use Deployment Controllers Instead

Kubernetes is loaded with a lot of features, and with its vibrant open source community, these features are constantly evolving and adding up.

Previously, you have seen the improvements from ReplicationControllers (RC), to ReplicaSets (RS). In this section you will see another K8s object which is highly recommended over Replication objects (RC and RS).

A Deployment is another layer above ReplicaSets and Pods, newer and more advanced level concept than ReplicaSets. It manages the deployment of ReplicaSets and allows for easy updating of a ReplicaSet as well as the ability to roll back to a previous version of deployment. It is declarative and can be used for rolling updates of micro-services, ensuring there is no downtime.

Officially, it is highly recommended to use Deplyments to manage replica sets rather than using replica sets directly.

Let us see Deployment in action.

Understand the layout of the deployment.yaml manifest below. Lets go through the 3 separated sections:

```yml
# Section 1 - This is the part that defines the deployment

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: nginx-deployment
labels:
tier: frontend

# Section 2 - This is the Replica set layer controlled by the deployment

spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
tier: frontend

# Section 3 - This is the Pod section controlled by the deployment and selected by the replica set in section 2.

template:
metadata:
labels:
tier: frontend
spec:
containers: - name: nginx
image: nginx:latest
ports: - containerPort: 80
```

Putting them altogether

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: nginx-deployment
labels:
tier: frontend
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
tier: frontend
template:
metadata:
labels:
tier: frontend
spec:
containers: - name: nginx
image: nginx:latest
ports: - containerPort: 8
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

Now, as we have got acquaited with most common Kubernetes workloads to deploy applications:

it is time to explore how Kubernetes is able to manage persistent data.

### PERSISTING DATA FOR PODS

Deployments are stateless by design. Hence, any data stored inside the Pod’s container does not persist when the Pod dies.

If you were to update the content of the index.html file inside the container, and the Pod dies, that content will not be lost since a new Pod will replace the dead one.

Exec into the running container (figure out the command yourself)

Install vim so that you can edit the file

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install vim
```

Update the content of the file and add the code below `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Welcome to DAREY.IO!</title>
    <style>
      body {
        width: 35em;
        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to DAREY.IO!</h1>

> Storage is a critical part of running containers, and Kubernetes offers some powerful primitives for managing it. Dynamic volume provisioning, a feature unique to Kubernetes, which allows storage volumes to be created on-demand. Without dynamic provisioning, DevOps engineers must manually make calls to the cloud or storage provider to create new storage volumes, and then create PersistentVolume objects to represent them in Kubernetes. The dynamic provisioning feature eliminates the need for DevOps to pre-provision storage. Instead, it automatically provisions storage when it is requested by users.

To make the data persist in case of a Pod’s failure, you will need to configure the Pod to use following objects:

- Persistent Volume or pv – is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.
- Persistent Volume Claim or pvc. Persistent Volume Claim is simply a request for storage, hence the "claim" in its name.

But where is it requesting this storage from?..

In the next project,

You will use Terraform to create a Kubernetes EKS cluster in AWS, and begin to use some powerful features such as PV, PVCs, ConfigMaps.

You will also be introduced to packaging Kubernetes manifests using Helm

Experience Dynamic provisioning of volumes to make your Pods stateful, using Kubernetes Statefulset

Deploying applications into Kubernetes using Helm Charts

And many more awesome technologies
