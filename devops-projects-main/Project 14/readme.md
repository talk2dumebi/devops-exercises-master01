# PROJECT 14 - EXPERIENCE CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION WITH JENKINS | ANSIBLE | ARTIFACTORY | SONARQUBE | PHP

## remeber theories

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE** – This project has some initial theoretical concepts that must be well understood before moving on to the practical part. Please read it carefully as many times as needed to completely digest the most important and fundamental DevOps concepts. To successfully implement this project, it is crucial to grasp the importance of the entire CI/CD process, roles of each tool and success metrics – so we encourage you to thoroughly study the following theory until you feel comfortable explaining all the concepts (e.g., to your new junior colleague or during a job interview).

## ANSIBLE ROLES FOR CI ENVIRONMENT

Now go ahead and Add two more roles to ansible:

- SonarQube (Scroll down to the Sonarqube section to see instructions on how to set up and configure SonarQube manually)
- Artifactory

![project14](./images/5.png)

### Why do we need SonarQube?

SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality, it is used to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities. Watch a short description here. There is a lot more hands on work ahead with SonarQube and Jenkins. So, the purpose of SonarQube will be clearer to you very soon.

### Why do we need Artifactory?

Artifactory is a product by JFrog that serves as a binary repository manager. The binary repository is a natural extension to the source code repository, in that the outcome of your build process is stored. It can be used for certain other automation, but we will it strictly to manage our build artifacts.

### Configuring Ansible For Jenkins Deployment

In previous projects, you have been launching Ansible commands manually from a CLI. Now, with Jenkins, we will start running Ansible from Jenkins UI.

![project14](./images/6.png)

![project14](./images/7.png)

To do this,

- Navigate to Jenkins URL

![project14](./images/8.png)

- Install & Open Blue Ocean Jenkins Plugin

- Create a new pipeline

![project14](./images/9.png)

- Select GitHub

- Connect Jenkins with GitHub

- Login to GitHub & Generate an Access Token

![project14](./images/10.png)

![project14](./images/11.png)

- Copy Access Token

- Paste the token and connect

- Create a new Pipeline

![project14](./images/12.png)

![project14](./images/13.png)

At this point you may not have a Jenkinsfile in the Ansible repository, so Blue Ocean will attempt to give you some guidance to create one. But we do not need that. We will rather create one ourselves. So, click on Administration to exit the Blue Ocean console.

Here is our newly created pipeline. It takes the name of your GitHub repository.

![project14](./images/14.png)

**Let us create our Jenkinsfile**

Inside the Ansible project, create a new directory deploy and start a new file Jenkinsfile inside the directory.

Add the code snippet below to start building the Jenkinsfile gradually. This pipeline currently has just one stage called Build and the only thing we are doing is using the shell script module to echo Building Stage

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Building Stage"'
        }
      }
    }
    }
}
```

![project14](./images/15.png)

Now go back into the Ansible pipeline in Jenkins, and select configure

Scroll down to Build Configuration section and specify the location of the Jenkinsfile at deploy/Jenkinsfile

Back to the pipeline again, this time click "Build now"

This will trigger a build and you will be able to see the effect of our basic Jenkinsfile configuration by going through the console output of the build.

![project14](./images/16.png)

![project14](./images/17.png)

![project14](./images/18.png)

To really appreciate and feel the difference of Cloud Blue UI, it is recommended to try triggering the build again from Blue Ocean interface.

- Click on Blue Ocean

- Select your project

- Click on the play button against the branch

![project14](./images/19.png)

> Notice that this pipeline is a multibranch one. This means, if there were more than one branch in GitHub, Jenkins would have scanned the repository to discover them all and we would have been able to trigger a build for each branch.

Let us see this in action.

- Create a new git branch and name it feature/jenkinspipeline-stages
  Currently we only have the Build stage. Let us add another stage called Test. Paste the code snippet below and push the new changes to GitHub.

```groovy
   pipeline {
    agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Building Stage"'
        }
      }
    }

    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo "Testing Stage"'
        }
      }
    }
    }
}
```

To make your new branch show up in Jenkins, we need to tell Jenkins to scan the repository.

- Click on the "Administration" button

- Navigate to the Ansible project and click on "Scan repository now"

- Refresh the page and both branches will start building automatically. You can go into Blue Ocean and see both branches there too.

In Blue Ocean, you can now see how the Jenkinsfile has caused a new step in the pipeline launch build for the new branch.

### A QUICK TASK FOR YOU!

1. Create a pull request to merge the latest code into the main branch
2. After merging the PR, go back into your terminal and switch into the main branch.
3. Pull the latest change.
4. Create a new branch, add more stages into the Jenkins file to simulate below phases. (Just add an echo command like we have in build and test stages)
   1. Package
   2. Deploy
   3. Clean up
5. Verify in Blue Ocean that all the stages are working, then merge your feature branch to the main branch
6. Eventually, your main branch should have a successful pipeline like this in blue ocean

## RUNNING ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK FROM JENKINS

Now that you have a broad overview of a typical Jenkins pipeline. Let us get the actual Ansible deployment to work by:

- Installing Ansible on Jenkins
- Installing Ansible plugin in Jenkins UI
- Creating Jenkinsfile from scratch. (Delete all you currently have in there and start all over to get Ansible to run successfully)

![project14](./images/24.png)

![project14](./images/25.png)

![project14](./images/26.png)

![project14](./images/27.png)

> Note: Ensure that Ansible runs against the Dev environment successfully.

> Possible errors to watch out for:

> Ensure that the git module in Jenkinsfile is checking out SCM to main branch instead of master (GitHub has discontinued the use of Master due to Black Lives Matter. You can read more here)

> Jenkins needs to export the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable. You can put the .ansible.cfg file alongside Jenkinsfile in the deploy directory. This way, anyone can easily identify that everything in there relates to deployment. Then, using the Pipeline Syntax tool in Ansible, generate the syntax to create environment variables to set.

### Possible issues to watch out for when you implement this

Remember that ansible.cfg must be exported to environment variable so that Ansible knows where to find Roles. But because you will possibly run Jenkins from different git branches, the location of Ansible roles will change. Therefore, you must handle this dynamically. You can use Linux Stream Editor sed to update the section roles_path each time there is an execution. You may not have this issue if you run only from the main branch.

If you push new changes to Git so that Jenkins failure can be fixed. You might observe that your change may sometimes have no effect. Even though your change is the actual fix required. This can be because Jenkins did not download the latest code from GitHub. Ensure that you start the Jenkinsfile with a clean up step to always delete the previous workspace before running a new one. Sometimes you might need to login to the Jenkins Linux server to verify the files in the workspace to confirm that what you are actually expecting is there. Otherwise, you can spend hours trying to figure out why Jenkins is still failing, when you have pushed up possible changes to fix the error.

Another possible reason for Jenkins failure sometimes, is because you have indicated in the Jenkinsfile to check out the main git branch, and you are running a pipeline from another branch. So, always verify by logging onto the Jenkins box to check the workspace, and run git branch command to confirm that the branch you are expecting is there.

If everything goes well for you, it means, the Dev environment has an up-to-date configuration. But what if we need to deploy to other environments?

Are we going to manually update the Jenkinsfile to point inventory to those environments? such as sit, uat, pentest, etc.
Or do we need a dedicated git branch for each environment, and have the inventory part hard coded there.
Think about those for a minute and try to work out which one sounds more like a better solution.

Manually updating the Jenkinsfile is definitely not an option. And that should be obvious to you at this point. Because we try to automate things as much as possible.

Well, unfortunately, we will not be doing any of the highlighted options. What we will be doing is to parameterise the deployment. So that at the point of execution, the appropriate values are applied.

Parameterizing Jenkinsfile For Ansible Deployment
To deploy to other environments, we will need to use parameters.

Update sit inventory with new servers

```yaml
[tooling]
<SIT-Tooling-Web-Server-Private-IP-Address>

[todo]
<SIT-Todo-Web-Server-Private-IP-Address>

[nginx]
<SIT-Nginx-Private-IP-Address>

[db:vars]
ansible_user=ec2-user
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python

[db]
<SIT-DB-Server-Private-IP-Address>
```

Update Jenkinsfile to introduce parameterization. Below is just one parameter. It has a default value in case if no value is specified at execution. It also has a description so that everyone is aware of its purpose.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    parameters {
      string(name: 'inventory', defaultValue: 'dev',  description: 'This is the inventory file for the environment to deploy configuration')
    }
}
```

In the Ansible execution section, remove the hardcoded inventory/dev and replace with `${inventory}

From now on, each time you hit on execute, it will expect an input.

Notice that the default value loads up, but we can now specify which environment we want to deploy the configuration to. Simply type sit and hit Run

## CI/CD PIPELINE FOR TODO APPLICATION

We already have tooling website as a part of deployment through Ansible. Here we will introduce another PHP application to add to the list of software products we are managing in our infrastructure. The good thing with this particular application is that it has unit tests, and it is an ideal application to show an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a particular application.

Our goal here is to deploy the application onto servers directly from Artifactory rather than from git. If you have not updated Ansible with an Artifactory role, simply use this guide to create an Ansible role for Artifactory (ignore the Nginx part). Configure Artifactory on Ubuntu 20.04

### Phase 1 – Prepare Jenkins

- Fork the repository below into your GitHub account
  https://github.com/darey-devops/php-todo.git

- On you Jenkins server, install PHP, its dependencies and Composer tool (Feel free to do this manually at first, then update your Ansible accordingly later)

  `sudo apt install -y zip libapache2-mod-php phploc php-{xml,bcmath,bz2,intl,gd,mbstring,mysql,zip}`

- Install Jenkins plugins

  - Plot plugin
  - Artifactory plugin

  ![project14](./images/31.png)

  ![project14](./images/32.png)

  ![project14](./images/33.png)

  ![project14](./images/34.png)

> We will use plot plugin to display tests reports, and code coverage information.

> The Artifactory plugin will be used to easily upload code artifacts into an Artifactory server.

- In Jenkins UI configure Artifactory

Configure the server ID, URL and Credentials, run Test Connection.

### Phase 2 – Integrate Artifactory repository with Jenkins

- Create a dummy Jenkinsfile in the repository

- Using Blue Ocean, create a multibranch Jenkins pipeline

- On the database server, create database and user

```mysql
Create database homestead;
CREATE USER 'homestead'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'sePret^i';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'homestead'@'%';
```

![project14](./images/35.png)

- Update the database connectivity requirements in the file .env.sample

- Update Jenkinsfile with proper pipeline configuration

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

  stages {

     stage("Initial cleanup") {
          steps {
            dir("${WORKSPACE}") {
              deleteDir()
            }
          }
        }

    stage('Checkout SCM') {
      steps {
            git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/darey-devops/php-todo.git'
      }
    }

    stage('Prepare Dependencies') {
      steps {
             sh 'mv .env.sample .env'
             sh 'composer install'
             sh 'php artisan migrate'
             sh 'php artisan db:seed'
             sh 'php artisan key:generate'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

![project14](./images/36.png)

> Notice the Prepare Dependencies section

> The required file by PHP is .env so we are renaming .env.sample to .env

> Composer is used by PHP to install all the dependent libraries used by the application

> php artisan uses the .env file to setup the required database objects – (After successful run of this step, login to the database, run show tables and you will see the tables being created for you)

- Update the Jenkinsfile to include Unit tests step

```groovy
    stage('Execute Unit Tests') {
      steps {
             sh './vendor/bin/phpunit'
      }
    }
```

![project14](./images/37.png)

![project14](./images/38.png)

### Phase 3 – Code Quality Analysis

This is one of the areas where developers, architects and many stakeholders are mostly interested in as far as product development is concerned.

As a DevOps engineer, you also have a role to play. Especially when it comes to setting up the tools.

For PHP the most commonly tool used for code quality analysis is `phploc`.

**The data produced by phploc can be ploted onto graphs in Jenkins.**

Add the code analysis step in Jenkinsfile. The output of the data will be saved in build/logs/phploc.csv file.

```groovy
stage('Code Analysis') {
  steps {
        sh 'phploc app/ --log-csv build/logs/phploc.csv'

  }
}
```

- Plot the data using plot Jenkins plugin.

> This plugin provides generic plotting (or graphing) capabilities in Jenkins. It will plot one or more single values variations across builds in one or more plots. Plots for a particular job (or project) are configured in the job configuration screen, where each field has additional help information. Each plot can have one or more lines (called data series). After each build completes the plots’ data series latest values are pulled from the CSV file generated by phploc.

```groovy
    stage('Plot Code Coverage Report') {
      steps {

            plot csvFileName: 'plot-396c4a6b-b573-41e5-85d8-73613b2ffffb.csv', csvSeries: [[displayTableFlag: false, exclusionValues: 'Lines of Code (LOC),Comment Lines of Code (CLOC),Non-Comment Lines of Code (NCLOC),Logical Lines of Code (LLOC)                          ', file: 'build/logs/phploc.csv', inclusionFlag: 'INCLUDE_BY_STRING', url: '']], group: 'phploc', numBuilds: '100', style: 'line', title: 'A - Lines of code', yaxis: 'Lines of Code'

            plot csvFileName: 'plot-396c4a6b-b573-41e5-85d8-73613b2ffffb.csv', csvSeries: [[displayTableFlag: false, exclusionValues: 'Cyclomatic Complexity / Lines of Code,Cyclomatic Complexity / Number of Methods ', file: 'build/logs/phploc.csv', inclusionFlag: 'INCLUDE_BY_STRING', url: '']], group: 'phploc', numBuilds: '100', style: 'line', title: 'D - Relative Cyclomatic Complexity', yaxis: 'Cyclomatic Complexity by Structure'
            plot csvFileName: 'plot-396c4a6b-b573-41e5-85d8-73613b2ffffb.csv', csvSeries: [[displayTableFlag: false, exclusionValues: 'Classes,Abstract Classes,Concrete Classes', file: 'build/logs/phploc.csv', inclusionFlag: 'INCLUDE_BY_STRING', url: '']], group: 'phploc', numBuilds: '100', style: 'line', title: 'E - Types of Classes', yaxis: 'Count'
            plot csvFileName: 'plot-396c4a6b-b573-41e5-85d8-73613b2ffffb.csv', csvSeries: [[displayTableFlag: false, exclusionValues: 'Methods,Non-Static Methods,Static Methods,Public Methods,Non-Public Methods', file: 'build/logs/phploc.csv', inclusionFlag: 'INCLUDE_BY_STRING', url: '']], group: 'phploc', numBuilds: '100', style: 'line', title: 'F - Types of Methods', yaxis: 'Count'

            plot csvFileName: 'plot-396c4a6b-b573-41e5-85d8-73613b2ffffb.csv', csvSeries: [[displayTableFlag: false, exclusionValues: 'Test Classes,Test Methods', file: 'build/logs/phploc.csv', inclusionFlag: 'INCLUDE_BY_STRING', url: '']], group: 'phploc', numBuilds: '100', style: 'line', title: 'I - Testing', yaxis: 'Count'
            plot csvFileName: 'plot-396c4a6b-b573-41e5-85d8-73613b2ffffb.csv', csvSeries: [[displayTableFlag: false, exclusionValues: 'Logical Lines of Code (LLOC),Classes Length (LLOC),Functions Length (LLOC),LLOC outside functions or classes ', file: 'build/logs/phploc.csv', inclusionFlag: 'INCLUDE_BY_STRING', url: '']], group: 'phploc', numBuilds: '100', style: 'line', title: 'AB - Code Structure by Logical Lines of Code', yaxis: 'Logical Lines of Code'
            plot csvFileName: 'plot-396c4a6b-b573-41e5-85d8-73613b2ffffb.csv', csvSeries: [[displayTableFlag: false, exclusionValues: 'Functions,Named Functions,Anonymous Functions', file: 'build/logs/phploc.csv', inclusionFlag: 'INCLUDE_BY_STRING', url: '']], group: 'phploc', numBuilds: '100', style: 'line', title: 'H - Types of Functions', yaxis: 'Count'
            plot csvFileName: 'plot-396c4a6b-b573-41e5-85d8-73613b2ffffb.csv', csvSeries: [[displayTableFlag: false, exclusionValues: 'Interfaces,Traits,Classes,Methods,Functions,Constants', file: 'build/logs/phploc.csv', inclusionFlag: 'INCLUDE_BY_STRING', url: '']], group: 'phploc', numBuilds: '100', style: 'line', title: 'BB - Structure Objects', yaxis: 'Count'

      }
    }
```

You should now see a Plot menu item on the left menu. Click on it to see the charts. (The analytics may not mean much to you as it is meant to be read by developers. So, you need not worry much about it – this is just to give you an idea of the real-world implementation).

- Bundle the application code for into an artifact (archived package) upload to Artifactory

```groovy
stage ('Package Artifact') {
    steps {
            sh 'zip -qr php-todo.zip ${WORKSPACE}/*'
     }
    }
```

- Publish the resulted artifact into Artifactory

```groovy
stage ('Upload Artifact to Artifactory') {
          steps {
            script {
                 def server = Artifactory.server 'artifactory-server'
                 def uploadSpec = """{
                    "files": [
                      {
                       "pattern": "php-todo.zip",
                       "target": "<name-of-artifact-repository>/php-todo",
                       "props": "type=zip;status=ready"

                       }
                    ]
                 }"""

                 server.upload spec: uploadSpec
               }
            }

        }
```

- Deploy the application to the dev environment by launching Ansible pipeline

```groovy
stage ('Deploy to Dev Environment') {
    steps {
    build job: 'ansible-project/main', parameters: [[$class: 'StringParameterValue', name: 'env', value: 'dev']], propagate: false, wait: true
    }
  }
```

> The build job used in this step tells Jenkins to start another job. In this case it is the ansible-project job, and we are targeting the main branch. Hence, we have ansible-project/main. Since the Ansible project requires parameters to be passed in, we have included this by specifying the parameters section. The name of the parameter is env and its value is dev. Meaning, deploy to the Development environment.

> But how are we certain that the code being deployed has the quality that meets corporate and customer requirements? Even though we have implemented Unit Tests and Code Coverage Analysis with phpunit and phploc, we still need to implement Quality Gate to ensure that ONLY code with the required code coverage, and other quality standards make it through to the environments.

> To achieve this, we need to configure SonarQube – An open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.

## SONARQUBE INSTALLATION

**For my sonarqube installation i used an ansible role. So i did'nt do the installation myself**

Before we start getting hands on with SonarQube configuration, it is incredibly important to understand a few concepts:

> Software Quality – The degree to which a software component, system or process meets specified requirements based on user needs and expectations.

> Software Quality Gates – Quality gates are basically acceptance criteria which are usually presented as a set of predefined quality criteria that a software development project must meet in order to proceed from one stage of its lifecycle to the next one.

SonarQube is a tool that can be used to create quality gates for software projects, and the ultimate goal is to be able to ship only quality software code.

> Despite that DevOps CI/CD pipeline helps with fast software delivery, it is of the same importance to ensure the quality of such delivery. Hence, we will need SonarQube to set up Quality gates. In this project we will use predefined Quality Gates (also known as The Sonar Way). Software testers and developers would normally work with project leads and architects to create custom quality gates.

- Install SonarQube on Ubuntu 20.04 With PostgreSQL as Backend Database

> Here is a manual approach to installation. Ensure that you can to automate the same with Ansible.

Below is a step by step guide how to install SonarQube 7.9.3 version. It has a strong prerequisite to have Java installed since the tool is Java-based. MySQL support for SonarQube is deprecated, therefore we will be using PostgreSQL.

- We will make some Linux Kernel configuration changes to ensure optimal performance of the tool – we will increase vm.max_map_count, file discriptor and ulimit.

- Tune Linux Kernel
  _This can be achieved by making session changes which does not persist beyond the current session terminal._

```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
sudo sysctl -w fs.file-max=65536
ulimit -n 65536
ulimit -u 4096
```

- To make a permanent change, edit the file `/etc/security/limits.conf` and append the below

```conf
sonarqube   -   nofile   65536
sonarqube   -   nproc    4096
```

Before installing, let us update and upgrade system packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install wget and unzip packages
sudo apt-get install wget unzip -y

# Install OpenJDK and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 11
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk -y
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre -y

# Set default JDK – To set default JDK or switch to OpenJDK enter below command:
sudo update-alternatives --config java


# If you have multiple versions of Java installed, you should see a list like below:


# Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status

# Type "1" to switch OpenJDK 11

# Verify the set JAVA Version:

java -version

# Install and Setup PostgreSQL 10 Database for SonarQube

# The command below will add PostgreSQL repo to the repo list:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'

# Download PostgreSQL software
wget -q https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc -O - | sudo apt-key add -

# Install PostgreSQL Database Server
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql postgresql-contrib

Start PostgreSQL Database Server

sudo systemctl start postgresql

# Enable it to start automatically at boot time
sudo systemctl enable postgresql

# Change the password for default postgres user (Pass in the password you intend to use, and remember to save it somewhere)

## CONFIGURE SONARQUBE

We cannot run SonarQube as a root user, if you run using root user it will stop automatically. The ideal approach will be to create a separate group and a user to run SonarQube

- Create a group sonar `sudo groupadd sonar`

Now add a user with control over the /opt/sonarqube directory

`sudo useradd -c "user to run SonarQube" -d /opt/sonarqube -g sonar sonar `
`sudo chown sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube -R`

- Open SonarQube configuration file using your favourite text editor (e.g., nano or vim)

`sudo vim /opt/sonarqube/conf/sonar.properties`

- Find the following lines:

```bash
#sonar.jdbc.username=
#sonar.jdbc.password=
Uncomment them and provide the values of PostgreSQL Database username and password:

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DATABASE

#

# IMPORTANT:

# - The embedded H2 database is used by default. It is recommended for tests but not for

#   production use. Supported databases are Oracle, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQLServer.

# - Changes to database connection URL (sonar.jdbc.url) can affect SonarSource licensed products.

# User credentials.

# Permissions to create tables, indices and triggers must be granted to JDBC user.

# The schema must be created first.

sonar.jdbc.username=sonar
sonar.jdbc.password=sonar
sonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sonarqube

# Edit the sonar script file and set RUN_AS_USER

sudo nano /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh

# If specified, the Wrapper will be run as the specified user.

# IMPORTANT - Make sure that the user has the required privileges to write

#  the PID file and wrapper.log files.  Failure to be able to write the log

#  file will cause the Wrapper to exit without any way to write out an error

#  message.

# NOTE - This will set the user which is used to run the Wrapper as well as

#  the JVM and is not useful in situations where a privileged resource or

#  port needs to be allocated prior to the user being changed.

RUN_AS_USER=sonar

# Now, to start SonarQube we need to do following:

# Switch to sonar user
sudo su sonar

# Move to the script directory
cd /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/

# Run the script to start SonarQube
./sonar.sh start

# Expected output shall be as:

# Starting SonarQube...÷\
# Started SonarQube

# Check SonarQube running status:
./sonar.sh status

# Sample Output below:
# SonarQube is running (176483).

# To check SonarQube logs, navigate to /opt/sonarqube/logs/sonar.log directory
tail /opt/sonarqube/logs/sonar.log

- Access SonarQube
  _To access SonarQube using browser, type server’s IP address followed by port 9000_
  `http://server_IP:9000/sonar OR http://localhost:9000/sonar`

- Login to SonarQube with default administrator username and password – `admin`

Now, when SonarQube is up and running, it is time to setup our Quality gate in Jenkins.

## CONFIGURE SONARQUBE AND JENKINS FOR QUALITY GATE

- In Jenkins, install SonarScanner plugin

- Navigate to configure system in Jenkins. Add SonarQube server as shown below:

`Manage Jenkins > Configure System`

- Generate authentication token in SonarQube

`User > My Account > Security > Generate Tokens`

- Configure Quality Gate Jenkins Webhook in SonarQube – The URL should point to your Jenkins server `http://{JENKINS_HOST}/sonarqube-webhook/`

`Administration > Configuration > Webhooks > Create`

- Setup SonarQube scanner from Jenkins – Global Tool Configuration

`Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration`

- Update Jenkins Pipeline to include SonarQube scanning and Quality Gate

_Below is the snippet for a Quality Gate stage in Jenkinsfile._

```groovy
    stage('SonarQube Quality Gate') {
        environment {
            scannerHome = tool 'SonarQubeScanner'
        }
        steps {
            withSonarQubeEnv('sonarqube') {
                sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner"
            }

        }
    }
```

![project14](./images/42.png)

![project14](./images/43.png)

**NOTE: The above step will fail because we have not updated `sonar-scanner.properties**

- Configure sonar-scanner.properties – From the step above, Jenkins will install the scanner tool on the Linux server. You will need to go into the tools directory on the server to configure the properties file in which SonarQube will require to function during pipeline execution.

`cd /var/lib/jenkins/tools/hudson.plugins.sonar.SonarRunnerInstallation/SonarQubeScanner/conf/`

- Open sonar-scanner.properties file
  `sudo vi sonar-scanner.properties`

- Add configuration related to php-todo project

```
sonar.host.url=http://<SonarQube-Server-IP-address>:9000
sonar.projectKey=php-todo
#----- Default source code encoding
sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
sonar.php.exclusions=**/vendor/**
sonar.php.coverage.reportPaths=build/logs/clover.xml
sonar.php.tests.reportPath=build/logs/junit.xml
```

> HINT: To know what exactly to put inside the sonar-scanner.properties file, SonarQube has a configurations page where you can get some directions.

A brief explanation of what is going on the the stage – set the environment variable for the scannerHome use the same name used when you configured SonarQube Scanner from Jenkins Global Tool Configuration. If you remember, the name was SonarQubeScanner. Then, within the steps use shell to run the scanner from bin directory.

To further examine the configuration of the scanner tool on the Jenkins server – navigate into the tools directory

`cd /var/lib/jenkins/tools/hudson.plugins.sonar.SonarRunnerInstallation/SonarQubeScanner/bin`

- List the content to see the scanner tool sonar-scanner. That is what we are calling in the pipeline script.

So far you have been given code snippets on each of the stages within the Jenkinsfile. But, you should also be able to generate Jenkins configuration code yourself.

### End-to-End Pipeline Overview

Indeed, this has been one of the longest projects from Project 1, and if everything has worked out for you so far, you should have a view like below:

But we are not completely done yet!

The quality gate we just included has no effect. Why? Well, because if you go to the SonarQube UI, you will realise that we just pushed a poor-quality code onto the development environment.

Navigate to php-todo project in SonarQube

There are bugs, and there is 0.0% code coverage. (code coverage is a percentage of unit tests added by developers to test functions and objects in the code)

If you click on php-todo project for further analysis, you will see that there is 6 hours’ worth of technical debt, code smells and security issues in the code.

In the development environment, this is acceptable as developers will need to keep iterating over their code towards perfection. But as a DevOps engineer working on the pipeline, we must ensure that the quality gate step causes the pipeline to fail if the conditions for quality are not met.

Conditionally deploy to higher environments
In the real world, developers will work on feature branch in a repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab). There are other branches that will be used differently to control how software releases are done. You will see such branches as:

- Develop
- Master or Main
- (The \_ is a place holder for a version number, Jira Ticket name or some description. It can be something like Release-1.0.0)
- Feature/\_
- Release/\_
- Hotfix/\_
- etc.

There is a very wide discussion around release strategy, and git branching strategies which in recent years are considered under what is known as GitFlow (Have a read and keep as a bookmark – it is a possible candidate for an interview discussion, so take it seriously!)

Assuming a basic gitflow implementation restricts only the develop branch to deploy code to Integration environment like sit.

- Let us update our Jenkinsfile to implement this:

First, we will include a When condition to run Quality Gate whenever the running branch is either develop, hotfix, release, main, or master
when { branch pattern: "^develop*|^hotfix*|^release*|^main*", comparator: "REGEXP"}

Then we add a timeout step to wait for SonarQube to complete analysis and successfully finish the pipeline only when code quality is acceptable.
timeout(time: 1, unit: 'MINUTES') {
waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
}

The complete stage will now look like this:

```groovy
    stage('SonarQube Quality Gate') {
      when { branch pattern: "^develop*|^hotfix*|^release*|^main*", comparator: "REGEXP"}
        environment {
            scannerHome = tool 'SonarQubeScanner'
        }
        steps {
            withSonarQubeEnv('sonarqube') {
                sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner -Dproject.settings=sonar-project.properties"
            }
            timeout(time: 1, unit: 'MINUTES') {
                waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
            }
        }
    }
```

To test, create different branches and push to GitHub. You will realise that only branches other than develop, hotfix, release, main, or master will be able to deploy the code.

> Notice that with the current state of the code, it cannot be deployed to Integration environments due to its quality. In the real world, DevOps engineers will push this back to developers to work on the code further, based on SonarQube quality report. Once everything is good with code quality, the pipeline will pass and proceed with sipping the codes further to a higher environment.
